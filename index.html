<h2>CHANEL - Men's cologne & Fragrance</h2>
<p>Called Coco in 1910, she opens a hat boutique named Chanel Modes at 21 rue Cambon.<br>
     Her hat was worn by well-known French actresses at the time, and she built up her fame to open a boutique store.<br>
     Chanel No. 5 was the first perfume released by French couturier Gabriel "Coco" Chanel in 1921. It has since released several women's fragrances.<br>
      And in 1955, the first perfume for men was created, <strong>Pour Monsieur</strong>.
       The fresh chypre scent revealed lemon top notes, spicy middle notes, and a woody trail.<br>
     It is the only men's perfume released while Coco Chanel was alive.</p>
    <p>In 1981, the second men's perfume, <strong>Antaeus</strong>, was released.
    The perfume contains the myth of a hero who is weak but strong with an intense and subtle scent of leather.<br>
     A powerful and sensitive symbol of masculinity.
    <p>In 1990, the third men's perfume, the <strong>Egoiste</strong>, was released.
        The original perfume breaks the code of men's perfume with sandalwood and Madagascar vanilla notes.<br>
         Jean-Paul Goode's advertising film won the Golden Lion at the 37th International Advertising Film Festival in Cannes.</p>
